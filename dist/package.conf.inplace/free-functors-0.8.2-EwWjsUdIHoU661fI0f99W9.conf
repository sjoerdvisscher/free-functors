synopsis: Free functors, adjoint to functors that forget class constraints.
description:
    A free functor is a left adjoint to a forgetful functor. It used to be the case
    that the only category that was easy to work with in Haskell was Hask itself, so
    there were no interesting forgetful functors.
    .
    But the new ConstraintKinds feature of GHC provides an easy way of creating
    subcategories of Hask. That brings interesting opportunities for free (and cofree) functors.
    .
    The examples directory contains an implementation of non-empty lists as free semigroups,
    and automata as free actions. The standard example of free higher order functors is free monads,
    and this definition can be found in Data.Functor.HFree.
